Iâ€™m a senior data scientist at [Statistical Bioinformatics lab] (https://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~wwang7/index.html) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. My Computer Science PhD was at the Bioinformatics Group (https://www.memphis.edu/cs/research/bioinformatics.php) at the University of Memphis where I worked with Dr Vinhthuy Phan and Dr. Ramin Homayouni.
